FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Personal Portfolio Webpage
<p>This is the fifth and final project of the Responsive Web Design Certification in Free Code Camp. The objective of this challenge was to build a personal portfolio webpage that meets the 11 user stories specified by Free Code Camp. I went above and beyond on this project and tinkered a lot with the CSS to make it attractive and fit the theme of my username, as well as to make it look good in both mobile and desktop versions.</p>
